The unit_test plans for G2 V3.1.0 are scripts in:
1. Change to v3.1.0/unit_test
2. There are three scripts to test G2 library version 3.1.0 and grib_util v1.0.5.
   Either run them each individually or execute the run_all_tests.sh script.

   A. test_cnvgrib_and cnvgrib21_gfs_wcoss.sh
   
         This script uses to test cnvgrib (prod) and cnvgrib21_gfs  
         The script will compare two output files: one is from cnvgrib and one is from cnvgrib21_gfs.
         The cnvgrib will correct the forecast hour > F252 when it convert from GRIB2 to GRIb1.
         Then, the WGRIB use to display content (inventory) of grib1 file for comparison
         and The result will write into output file:  $file.grib1.cnvgrib_cnvgrib21gfs.wgrib.o.
   
   B. test_cnvgrib_prod_and_new_wcoss.sh
   
         This script uses to test the utility cnvgrib which compiled with new G2 library v3.1.0
         The script will compare two output files: one is old cnvgrib (current in operational) and
         one is new cnvgrib (cnvgrib v3.1.0).
         The conversion cnvgrib will convert from grib2 to grib1 and from grib1 to grib2.
         Then, the WGRIB2 and DEGRIB2 use to display content (inventory) of grib2 file for comparison
         and The result will write into output file:  $file.grib2.prod_test.wgrib2.o.
   
   
   C. test_copygb2_prod_and_new_wcoss.sh
   
         This script uses to test the utility copygb2 which compiled with new G2 library v3.1.0
         The script will compare two output files: one is copygb2 (current in operational) and
         one is new copygb2 (grib_util.v1.0.5).
         The copygb2 will interpolate into small grid. Then, the WGRIB2 and DEGRIB2 use to display content
         (inventory) of grib2 file for comparison and The result will write into output file:
         awps_file_f${fcsthrs}_${GRID}_copygb2_prod_test.o

                   ********  NOTE  *************
 All test data files are in  /gpfs/sss/emc/global/shared/nceplibs/fix on LUNA or SURGE
